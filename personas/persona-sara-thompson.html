            Sara Thompson, 35, is a middle school teacher, who is somewhat comfortable with tech and various software
            applications. She wants to find a way to introduce her students to budgeting and personal finance, giving
            them hands-on experience. She wants a tool that is accessible and easy to understand, use, and navigate
            without unnecessary complexity. She does not want to use existing tools, like quickbooks, that require
            account registration or
            other steps that could be a barrier to students.
