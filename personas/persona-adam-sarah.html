            Adam, age 32, and Sarah, age 30, are a newly engaged couple who are planning a wedding.
            Adam is a sales representative for solar panels, and he works part-time as a freelance writer.
            Sarah is an administrative assistant for her local city water district.
            They do not have any children, but plan to start a family after they get married.
            Sarah uses software products in her career to keep track of bonds and measure the progress of long-term
            projects.
            Adam uses software products to meet with clients virtually but is reluctant as he prefers talking to people
            in person.
