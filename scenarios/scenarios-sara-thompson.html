        <!--Add your scenarios-->
        <h2>Scenario 1:</h2>
        <p class="scenario">Sara is creating a personal finance lesson for her middle school class. She intends to have
            students create a fictional budget, helping them understand how to balance income and expenses. She needs a
            simple, web-based budgeting tool that requires
            no login, and is easy for her middle school students to use in a 45-minute session.
        </p>

        <h2>Scenario 2:</h2>
        <p class="scenario">During Sara's class, each student will need to access the budgeting tool on their computer
            to create their budget. They are
            tasked with managing predefined income and expenses, categorizing those expenses (such as food,
            entertainment, savings),
            and adjusting the inputs to balance their budget. Sarah needs to ensure that the tool is intuitive and
            provides
            immediate support for students who are unfamiliar with budgeting.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Scenario 3:</h2>
        <p class="scenario">At the end of the lesson, Sara wants to make sure that students can export their completed
            budgets as PDFs, which they
            will then print out for submission and to keep for themselves. She wants students to be able to review their
            budgets at
            home to study for a future quiz, so having an easily accessible download of their budget, without the need
            for
            additional steps or setup, is important.
