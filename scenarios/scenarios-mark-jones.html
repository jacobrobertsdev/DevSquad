        <!--Add your scenarios-->
        <h2>Scenario 1:</h2>
        <p class="scenario"> Mark receives financial aid, a scholarship, some money from parents, as well as a part time
            job. Mark needs to keep
            track of these different sources of income and ensure they are used effectively for tuition, books, and
            personal
            expenses. A budgeting tool can help Mark categorize and allocate funds appropriately, avoiding overspending
            and
            ensuring all financial needs are met.
