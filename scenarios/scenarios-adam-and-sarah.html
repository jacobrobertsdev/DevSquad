        <h2>Adam and Sarah’s scenario: Planning for the big day</h2>
        <p class="scenario">
            Sarah has been asking Adam to help her come up with a budget for their wedding, but Adam likes to give her hypothetical figures with little reason behind them. 
            Adam is not the most organized and his paychecks, being a sales associate, are inconsistent. 
            This makes it difficult to know how much money they will be able to spend on various aspects of their wedding without tracking how much money they are making and spending each month.

            Sarah starts by talking with other couples who have already gotten married to get an idea of how much money they should expect to spend, but she wants a more concrete idea of what they can afford. 

            She uses the calculator app on her computer to add up their monthly expenses and writes them into a notebook, 
            but she struggles to keep her numbers organized and has no way of quickly calculating a change in costs. 

            She needs a place to track her monthly expenses and see what those expenses would be if she cut back their spending in certain areas all the while being a clear and organized living document. 

            Sarah downloads the BreadSheet application and can easily use its features by typing in each category of their spending and how much they spend. 
            It calculates the total they have spent and has a place for their monthly income to see how much they have left to spend. 
            It is friendly enough that Adam can update BreadSheet every week and their tracking has put them on schedule to begin saving for their wedding.

        <h2>Adam and Sarah’s scenario: Inconsistent pay</h2>
        <p class="scenario">
            Adam is a sales associate and a freelance writer. His job calls for an inconsistent paycheck each month and this can be a challenge for Adam and Sarah to organize. 
            Since Adam’s paycheck might be more or less than the previous paycheck, they must budget their expenses differently each month. 

            Adam is reluctant to use different organizational methods and often gives hypothetical numbers to spend on their different expenses. He likes to estimate his money and not give his spending much thought. 
            Because of this, Adam usually does not have much of his paycheck left at the end of the month, but Sarah believes that they could do a better job saving their money. 
            
            After payday, Adam and Sarah are trying to break down what they can spend, and Adam says that they can just spend roughly what they usually spend on groceries and gas this month. 
            Sarah, wanting a more concrete figure, shows Adam the BreadSheet application. They input Adam’s pay into BreadSheet and they put in their idea of their budget for each of the categories they spend in. 
            They realize that they are barely affording what they usually afford on Adam’s paycheck this month and decide to cut back in some aspects of their budget for this month. 
            After seeing BreadSheet calculating their total paycheck after expenses and being able to change numbers easily while BreadSheet instantly calculates the remaining money, they were able to save a lot more for their wedding this month than they had originally thought.

        <h2>Adam and Sarah’s scenario: Unexpected Expenses</h2>
        <p class="scenario">
            Adam and Sarah have been using BreadSheet to input what they would like to spend in each category of their expenses and see what money they have left over to save, 
            but they find difficulty when they add expenses to their monthly budget that falls outside of what they normally spend. 

            Sarah has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, stopping her from working, and she must pay for physical therapy. 
            Because their money has drastically changed, and they must add an expense to their monthly budget, Sarah and Adam are having a hard time figuring out what they should be spending on for their monthly expenses. 
            
            Adam tried BreadSheets suggestion feature and can input their monthly pay and how much they would like to save. 
            Adam inputs 10% and BreadSheet calculates a suggestion of how much to spend in each of their categories while saving 10% of their monthly budget. 
            This helps Sarah and Adam organize their money and stay on track with their savings.
