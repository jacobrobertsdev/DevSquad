## Product Vision Statement

**Vision Statement:**
For anyone who could benefit from a very quick and high-level overview of their finances, BreadSheet is a budgeting tool that allows quick input and output of financial information for the user's records. Unlike subscription services, products that require set up, or that save/sell/have control over your data with no interoperability, BreadSheet is fast, easy, and will store data temporarily and only if the user chooses.
