        <h3>Have you used a budgeting app before? Which ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Iâ€™ve used the self-employed version of quickbooks.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Financial goals? Budgeting Challenges?</h3>
        <p>
            I would like to come up with a new monthly budget based on all of my
            current income and expenses. My goal is to pay down debts and to figure
            out how much I can spend to do that.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>
            How often do you review/make a budget and what prompts you to do so?
        </h3>
        <p>Almost never, I tend to avoid it because it can be a bit stressful.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Whats an app you like to use and why?</h3>
        <p>
            I like apps that provide simple but useful functionality (i.e. tools,
            utilities).
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>
            What are the most important features you would want to have in a
            budgeting app/website if you were going to use one?
        </h3>
        <p>Easy, simple, friendly, pleasant and encouraging to use</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>
            What would you not want to have to do/use or steps you would not want to
            take when using a budgeting application?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I would not want complicated categories, lists, etc. The simpler the
            better.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How do you think a budgeting app could help you?</h3>
        <p>
            It could help me build a habit of checking in on my finances more, which
            would bring me closer to my goals.
