        <h3>How do you currently manage your budget? What tools or methods
            are you using now? </h3>
        <p>Notebook, paper, envelopes, banking app. </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What difficulties do you face with your current budgeting method? </h3>
        <p>Knowing when bills will be due, knowing how much I can spend on
            a given day, and how long my current budget will take to open up a bit.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3> Are there financial goals you have that you feel a budgeting tool will NOT help with?</h3>
        <p>I’ve been interested in the stock market, and I’m unsure a budgeting tool could help with that. </p>

        <hr />
        <h3>Do you prefer mobile app or website tools? </h3>
        <p>Generally mobile apps, but for a budget tool I think I would prefer a desktop situation.</p>

        <hr />
        <h3>Do you like notification/reminders to remain interactive with the tool? What kind of
            notifications/reminders do you like most? </h3>
        <p>I typically turn off notifications if I have the option, being someone with ADHD, they
            often have the opposite effect on me.</p>

        <hr />
        <h3>Is customization important to you? </h3>
        <p>Yes, especially since anything could happen that might change the budget.</p>
