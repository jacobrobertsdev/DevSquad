        <h3>Have you used a budget tracking application before?</h3>
        <p>Not an application just meant for budgeting. I have used excel spreadsheets to help me organize my spending.

        <hr />
        <h3>How often do you usually budget and what are you budgeting for?</h3>
        <p>I get paid every two weeks, so I usually budget on or around my payday. I budget for things like my bi-weekly
            grocery spending, gas, and rent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What do you feel budgeting gives you and what do you want to make easier when you budget?</h3>
        <p>I think budgeting gives me a sense of control and clarity when it comes to my money. I can easily over spend
            if I am not aware of how much I should be spending on certain things.
            I would like to be able to have a total amount of money lef tfor the month constantly updated as I update my
            spending throughout the 2 weeks that I am tracking.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you not like about budgeting that you wish you didnt have to do?</h3>
        <p>The hardest part for me about budgeting is estimating how much I should be spending in my normal expenses. It
            would be really convenient if a program could suggest amounts to spend
            in each area so I can just adjust those numbers and not try to figure it out all by my self.
