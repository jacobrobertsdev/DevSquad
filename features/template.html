        <li>As a teacher, I want a simple web-based budgeting tool that requires no account setup for my students</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I want students to be able to access the app via a link, so they can start working on
            their
            budgets</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I want the tool to have a clean and minimal interface, so students can easily navigate it
        </li>
        <li>As a teacher, I need my students to be able to input their income and expenses easily, so they can
            quickly
            create a
            budget</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I need my students to save their work temporarily during the session, so they don’t lose
            any progress
            if something happens to their computer</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I want my students to review and adjust their budget before finalizing it, so I can ensure
            it’s accurate and
            balanced</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I need my students to see clear labels and indicators relevant to budgeting, so they can
            better understand the
            process as they work.</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I want my students to export their completed budget as a PDF, they can easily print or
            submit it for
            their assignment</li>
        <li>As a teacher, I want the tool to provide preset categories for common expenses, so students can quickly
            fill out a budget
            without spending time on unnecessary things</li>
