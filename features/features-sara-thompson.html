        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <strong>As a teacher, I want a simple web-based budgeting tool that requires no
            account setup for my students
        </strong>
        <strong>As a teacher, I want students to be able to access the app via a link,
            so they can start working on their budgets</strong>
        <strong>As a teacher, I want the tool to have a clean and minimal interface, so
            students can easily navigate it</strong>
        <strong>As a teacher, I need my students to save their work temporarily during
            the session, so they don’t lose any progress if something happens to
            their computer</strong>
        <strong>As a teacher, I want my students to export their completed budget as a
            PDF, they can easily print or submit it for their assignment</strong>
        <strong>As a teacher, I need my students to be able to input their income and
            expenses easily, so they can quickly create a budget</strong>
        <p>
            As a teacher, I want my students to review and adjust their budget
            before finalizing it, so I can ensure it’s accurate and balanced
        </p>
        <p>
            As a teacher, I need my students to see clear labels and indicators
            relevant to budgeting, so they can better understand the process as they
            work.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a teacher, I want the tool to provide preset categories for common
            expenses, so students can quickly fill out a budget without spending
            time on unnecessary things
        </p>

        <h2>Constraints:</h2>
        <p>
            It may be worth having a free or light version that does not require
            login (the minimum viable product), and a more fully-featured paid
            version with user accounts.
        </p>
